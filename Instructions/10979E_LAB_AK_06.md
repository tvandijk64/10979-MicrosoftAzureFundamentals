1. On the **labcontainer** blade, click the newly uploaded blob.

1. On the **Blob properties** blade, click the **Click to copy** icon next to the **URL** text box.

1. If prompted whether to allow the web page access the Clipboard, click **Allow access**.

1. Start Microsoft Edge and, in the **Search or enter web address** text box, paste the URL you copied from the Azure portal.

1. Note the **ResourceNotFound** error message. This is expected since the blob is residing in a private container, which requires authenticated access. 

1. Close the Microsoft Edge window.

1. Switch to the Microsoft Edge window displaying the Azure portal and, on the **splashscreen.contrast-white_scale-400.png** blade, click the **Generate SAS** tab. 

1. On the **Generate SAS** tab, enable the **HTTP** option and click **Generate blob SAS token and URL**. 

1. Click the **Click to copy** icon next to the **Blob SAS URL** text box.

1. Open a new Microsoft Edge window and, in the **Search or enter web address** text box, paste the Blob SAS URL you copied from the Azure portal.

1. Note that you can view the image. This is expected since this time you are authorized to access the blob based on the SAS token included in the URL. 

1. Close all Microsoft Edge windows.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have created a blob container, uploaded a file into it, and accessed it by using a SAS token.
